Basic concepts
==============

Layers
------

Docker is the container-engine in which all services and tools are run, this ensures a maximum of portability across
 platforms and environments.

> TODO: Link to Docker Docs

### Services

Services are defined in `docker-compose.yml` they describe the stack components, such as the PHP application, databases,
caches or testing containers.

- [View application service definition](https://github.com/phundament/app/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

### Images

#### Runtime

- [`dmstr/docker-php-yii2`](https://github.com/dmstr/docker-php-yii2) PHP runtime prepared for Yii 2.0 Framework
- *phundament/nginx-one (for running PHP and nginx as separate containers)*

#### Pre-build application template images

- [`dmstr/docker-yii2-app`](https://github.com/dmstr/docker-yii2-app)
- [`dmstr/phd5-app`](https://github.com/dmstr/phd5-app)

### Stacks

Stacks and their service definitions can have different flavours. You may need slightly different setups in development, testing, staging
and production environment. 

**phd** supports [extending configurations](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) from `docker-compose`.

### Containers

The application along with other services are run in containers, usually you have one container per service, but
you can also scale PHP-FPM with a haproxy or run multiple workers off a CLI container.

- [View application Dockerfile](https://github.com/phundament/app/blob/master/Dockerfile)
- [View phd Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/phundament/)
- [View phd Docker images source-code](https://github.com/phundament/docker-images)

### Source-code

The topmost layer of the stack is the application source-code in `/src`. The PHP application is build with
Yii 2.0 Framework.

- [View application ENV variables](https://github.com/phundament/app/tree/master/.env-dist)
- [View application source](https://github.com/phundament/app/tree/master/src)
- [View application tests](https://github.com/phundament/app/tree/master/tests)

#### Application framework and composer packages

The building blocks of the application.
