# Host-system CLI tools

## `make` application

phd uses `Makefile`s to execute common tasks during development, but you can also use standard *Docker* commands to control your stack.

Basically, `make` **targets** are just shorthands for lengthy Docker commands.

> TODO: Link "Backend", "Frontend"

## CLI

To see all available targets run

    make help

After the initial `.env` configuration, for first initial setup run

    make all

You can also chain single **targets**

    make setup up open bash

Or run `docker-compose` commands against your current stack

	docker-compose ps
	docker-compose logs

   
Or use `Makefile`s for a different folder i.e. for managing an isolated test-stack
   
	cd tests
    make all
    make run-tests

You can find information in the [testing](../4-testing/testing.md) section.

> :bulb: `make` targets are run on the stack as `docker-compose` without additional parameters.

> :bulb: To do a dry-run for a command you can use the `-n` option, eg. `make -n all`

> :warning: removing containers, i.e. with `make clean` removes also data stored only in the container, you can use host-volumes for persisting data during development 

### `Make` vs. Docker commands


You can create a new container bash with

    make bash

or    
    
    docker-compose run --rm php bash

Alternatively you can also execute a bash within a running container
    
    docker-compose exec php bash
    
or

    docker exec -it myapp_php_1 bash


#### Examples

Setup application with demo data and default user password

    docker-compose run --rm \
        -e APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=mod.Uless11 \
        -e APP_MIGRATION_LOOKUP=@app/migrations/demo-data \
        php yii app/setup

### Help 

Run `make help`

```
#
# General targets

usage: make [target ...]

system:
  help.....................show this help

development:
  all......................shorthand for 'build init up setup open'
  dev......................install composer package (enable host-volume in docker-compose config)
  init.....................initialize development environment
  bash.....................open application development bash
  upgrade..................update application package, pull, rebuild
  assets...................open application development bash
  latest...................push to latest/release branch
  lint.....................run source-code linting
  lint-composer............run composer linting

base:
  build....................build images in test-stack
  up.......................start stack
  clean....................remove all containers in stack
  open.....................open application web service in browser
  open-db..................open application database service in browser
  setup....................run application setup
```

### Dry-run

    cp -n .env-dist .env &2>/dev/null
    cp -n project/tests/.env-dist project/tests/.env &2>/dev/null
    cp -n project/config/local.env-dist project/config/local.env &2>/dev/null
    docker-compose run --rm php composer install
    mkdir -p web/assets runtime
### Building images from docker-compose definitions
    docker-compose build --pull 
### Starting application stack
    docker-compose up -d
# Running application setup command (database, user)
    docker-compose run --rm php yii app/setup
# Opening application on mapped web-service port
    xdg-open http://localhost:21548 &>/dev/null
